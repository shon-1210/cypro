\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid cypro object.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. Denotes the track variables whoose summary you
want to display over time. Use \code{getTrackVariableNames()} to obtain all
valid input options.}

\item{across}{Character value, character vector or NULL (see details for more).
Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingVariableNames()} to obtain all variable names that group the
cells of your experiment in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector, list of character vectors or NULL (see details for
more). Specifies the particular groups of interest the grouping variable specified in argument
\code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{relevel}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the input order of \code{across_subset}
determines the order in which the groups of interest are displayed. Groups that
are not included are dropped which affects the choice of color.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. One of \emph{'mean'}, \emph{'median'},
\emph{'max'} or \emph{'min'}.}

\item{phase}{Character or numeric. If character, the ordinal value referring to the phase of interest (e.g. \emph{'first'}, \emph{'second'} etc.).
referring to the phase of interest or \emph{'all'}. If numeric, the number referring to the phase.

If set to NULL takes the phase denoted as default with \code{adjustDefault()}.

Ignored if the experiment design contains only one phase.}

\item{linesize}{Numeric value. Denotes the size of the lines drawn.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If set to TRUE the values are smoothed.}

\item{smooth_method}{Character value. Denotes the model type used to display the line. Defaults to
\emph{'lm'} (linear model). Given to argument \code{method} of function \code{ggplot2::geom_smooth()}.}

\item{smooth_span}{NUmeric value. Denotes the smoothing span used.}

\item{smooth_se}{Logical. If set to TRUE the standard error will be displayed.}

\item{display_vline}{Logical value. If set to TRUE and more than one phase
is referred to a vertical line is displayed hihglighting the phase separation.}

\item{vline_clr}{Character value. Color of the vertical line.}

\item{vline_type}{Character value. Defaults to \emph{'dashed'}.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\value{
A ggplot.

\description{
Uses the design of a lineplot to visualize feature
dynamics over time across a grouping variable of interest.
